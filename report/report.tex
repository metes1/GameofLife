\maketitle

This MIS document contains modules, types, and methods for implementing the state of a game of Conway's Game of Life. The modules cover the Model and View portions of the Model View Controller design pattern. The GameBoard module stores the state of the game and the View module can display the state of the game board using ASCII graphics.

The text file has the following format. Each line represents a row in the game board. There are 20 lines, each containing 20 numbers (0 or 1) separated by a comma.  Each comma-separated number represents a cell in the game board. The value of the number represents the state of that cell. A 0 represents a DEAD cell and a 1 represents an ALIVE cell.

\section*{Critique of Design}

\indent Firstly, my design follows the principle of consistency because the coding style and variable naming is consistent, which makes the code easier to read. For example, a string argument is always named $s$, a GameBoard argument is always named $game$, and the boardT indices are always referred to using $i$ and $j$. In addition, referring to the size of the game board using the exported constant SIZE, instead of the number 20 also makes the design more consistent. If someone ever wanted to change the design so it has a larger game board, they would only have to change one line of code (the \#define SIZE 20 line) instead of having to change every place where the game board size is used.

\medskip

\indent In regards to cohesion, creating a GameBoard module and a View module instead of just one module is an example of how my design follows this principle. The functions in each module are now more closely related to one another than if they were all put in one module. The functions in the GameBoard module are all directly related to the game board itself, like initializing it, transitioning to the next state, and getting one of its cell values. The View module's functions are different from GameBoard's functions because they are solely for "viewing" the module. Both of View's functions output the game state either to the console or a text file. Since my design follows the MVC design pattern, it is more cohesive. 

\medskip

\indent In regards to information hiding, making the variable $b$, which holds the state of each cell in the game board, private follows this principle. The contents of $b$ can't be tampered with and can only be accessed through using the class' public functions. 

\bigskip

\indent A way my design follow the principle of generality is that it can take any input file (that still follows the proper format). Initially, I was going to make the init function not take a file name as an argument. It was just going to automatically read from the file input.txt. Enabling the init function to take any file makes the design more general because the initial state of the game board can now be anything, it is not predefined. Furthermore, my design follows the essentiality and minimality qualities as it only contains the functions that it needs to work properly. There are no additional uneeded or unused functions. The minimal functions that it does have are essential for the program to work as intended.\\ \\
